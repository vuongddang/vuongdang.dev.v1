This article discusses how to use Fontawesome 5 - [free version](https://fontawesome.com/plans) in a Next.js project. The code example is written in TypeScript.

## 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core \
             @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons \
             @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons \
             @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
```

## 2. Use it like a pro
This is the easiest way to get started, you import individual icons and use it directly in your component.
```typescript
import { ReactElement } from 'react'
import { faCoffee } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'

export default function MyComponent(): ReactElement {
  return <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCoffee} />
}
```

## 3. A little more complex way
Imagine you use the same icon in multiple components but you don't want to import it in every component. 

This can be done by defining a library in your pages/_app.tsx.

In the code below, You add all brand icons `fab`, and a single coffee icon `faCoffee` into the library. 

```typescript
import { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import '../styles/index.css'
import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core'
import { fab } from '@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons'
import { faCoffee } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
import { ReactElement } from 'react'

library.add(fab, faCoffee)

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps): ReactElement {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

```

In your component, you can refer to the icon in the library.

In your library, you added all brand icons `fab`. Therefore you will refer to a particular icon (e.g `twitter`) in the set by specifying `['fab', 'twitter']`. On the other hand, you imported a single `faCoffee` so you refer to the icon name `coffee` directly.

```typescript
import { ReactElement } from 'react'
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'

export default function IconFromLibrary(): ReactElement {
  return (
    <>
      <FontAwesomeIcon icon={['fab', 'twitter']} />
      <FontAwesomeIcon icon="coffee" />
    </>
  )
}
```
