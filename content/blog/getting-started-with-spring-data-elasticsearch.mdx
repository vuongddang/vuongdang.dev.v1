In this article, I want to cover some basic steps on how to get an Elasticsearch node up and running and how to connect, index, and search data in Elasticsearch from a Java application using the Spring Data Elasticsearch library.

I also describe some common tasks e.g How to index a field so that we can do search and order on the same field. How to build the query to search and filter on multiple fields.

# Create a new Springboot Project
Whenever I need a new Springboot project, I go to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) to generate it. Here's my setup:


![Screen Shot 2020-10-16 at 17.53.15.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1602845615123/JwqaoRx-r.png)

After choosing the desired project name, and dependencies, click Generate, then extract the downloaded zip file. In this example, the project directory is `spring-data-elasticsearch-example`

# Ensure Elasticsearch is up and running

To get started, I need to have Elasticsearch running so that my application can connect to. Here're some options:

### Option 1: Start Elasticsearch node with docker-compose
Since I already have docker and docker-compose installed on my mac  ([Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)). I create a `elasticsearch.yml` file and start the Elasticsearch container with docker-compose:

Create `elasticsearch.yml` in `src/main/docker`
```bash
cd spring-data-elasticsearch-example

mkdir -p src/main/docker && touch src/main/docker/elasticsearch.yml
```

With the following content:
```yml
version: '2'
services:
  my-elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.9.2
    container_name: my-elasticsearch
    # volumes:
    #     - ~/data/my-elasticsearch/:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data/
    ports:
      - 9200:9200
    environment:
      - 'ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m'
      - 'discovery.type=single-node'
```

Then start Elasticsearch container
```bash
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/elasticsearch.yml up -d
```
Elasticsearch is now up and running at  [http://localhost:9200/](http://localhost:9200/) 

More information can be found on the Elasticsearch  [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html) 


### Option 2:  Using a Elasticsearch SaaS like [bonsai](https://app.bonsai.io/) 
Bonsai offers a free hobby plan that is perfect for learning/assessment purposes.

Just register an account at  [bonsai](https://app.bonsai.io/signup) and head over to **Access > Credentials** to get the **URL** to connect to in the next step. Similar to the docker-compose solution, I can access the **URL** in the browser to make sure it's running properly


# Index data in ElasticSearch

Given that I have the following sample Entities: Book and Author. I would like to index all the Books and their authors in an index called 'books'.

### Create entities and define how we want to index

![entities.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1602864505888/XH3PjjwLa.png)

```Java
@Getter
@Setter
@Accessors(chain = true)
@EqualsAndHashCode
@ToString
@Document(indexName="books")
public class Book {
    @Id
    private String id;

    @MultiField(
        mainField = @Field(type = FieldType.Text, fielddata = true),
        otherFields = {
                @InnerField(suffix = "raw", type = FieldType.Keyword)
        }
    )
    private String name;

    @Field(type = FieldType.Text)
    private String summary;

    @Field(type = FieldType.Double)
    private Double price;

    @Field(type = FieldType.Object)
    private List<Author> authors;
}
```
In Book entity, I use different annotations like @Document, @Id, @Field, @MultiField  to instruct Elasticsearch how I want that Entity, and Properties to be indexed. 

- `@Document(indexName="books")` indicates that I want to store the books in an index called `books`. By default, the index mapping will be created I start the Java application.  The @Document annotation has many attributes. More details can be found in the official  [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html/#reference) 

  - shards: the number of shards for the index.
  - replicas: the number of replicas for the index.
  - createIndex: Configuration whether to create an index on repository bootstrapping. The default value is true.

- `@Id`: used for identity purpose, this helps query the book by id or update an existing book in Elasticsearch.

- `@Field`:  used for specifying the kind of data the field contains, such as strings or boolean values, and its intended use. The list of data types can be found in [mapping-types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-types.html) documentation.
Additionally, [analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analyzer.html), [searchAnalyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-analyzer.html), and [normalizer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/normalizer.html) can be customized. In Elasticsearch, the [standard analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-standard-analyzer.html) is the default analyzer.

Here're how Book's properties are indexed using the above annotations:

- `summary` has the Text type, and the `price` has the Double type. 

- `name` is indexed to both Text and Keyword fields using `@MultiField` annotation. The main `Text` field is analyzed for full-text search meanwhile the `@InnerField` `raw` is `Keyword` which will be left as-is in Elasticsearch and can be used for sorting (or filtering in case of Author's name below). Since `raw` is an inner field, we can access it as `name.raw`.
- `authors` is indexed as a nested JSON object. 

The Author entity 
```java
@Getter
@Setter
@Accessors(chain = true)
@EqualsAndHashCode
@ToString
public class Author {
    @Id
    private String id;

    @MultiField(
        mainField = @Field(type = FieldType.Text, fielddata = true),
        otherFields = {
                @InnerField(suffix = "raw", type = FieldType.Keyword)
        }
    )
    private String name;
}
```
The Author entity can contain other nested objects e.g Contacts but for this blog post, I keep it simple as is.

Similar to Book's name, `Author's name` is also indexed as `Text` (mainField) and Keyword (innerField `raw`) so that we can search on `author.name` field, and Filter and Sort on `author.name.raw` field. 

### Configure the High Level REST Client
The next step is configuring the connection to my running Elasticserach and creating the repository so that I can index and search for books.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableElasticsearchRepositories(
        basePackages = "dev.vuongdang.springdataelasticsearchexample.repository"
)
public class ElasticSearchConfig extends AbstractElasticsearchConfiguration {

    @Override
    @Bean
    public RestHighLevelClient elasticsearchClient() {

        final ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = ClientConfiguration.builder()
                .connectedTo("localhost:9200")
                .build();

        return RestClients.create(clientConfiguration).rest();
    }
}

```

It is required to configure the ClientConfiguration, however, the higher-level abstractions `Elasticsearch Repositories` are normally used in the application.

`@EnableElasticsearchRepositories` activates the Repository support for all repositories interfaces defined in the `dev.vuongdang.springdataelasticsearchexample.repository` package. Thanks to Spring Data Elasticsearch, I can define the interface, and the implementation will be handled automatically.

The ClienConfiguration above can be set options for SSL, connect and socket timeouts, headers, and other parameters. For example:
```java
ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = ClientConfiguration.builder()
  .connectedTo("localhost:9200")                      
  .useSsl()                                                             
  .withConnectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))                            
  .withSocketTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3))                             
  .withBasicAuth(username, password);  
```

The above ClientConfiguration connects to `localhost:9200`. In case you use `app.bonsai.io` the configuration may look like this:

```java
final ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = ClientConfiguration.builder()
                .connectedTo("sass-testing-1537538524.eu-central-1.bonsaisearch.net:443")
                .usingSsl()
                .withBasicAuth("<username>", "<password>")
                .build();
```

### Create the Repository

```java
/**
 * Define the repository interface. The implementation is done by Spring Data Elasticsearch
 */
public interface BookSearchRepository extends ElasticsearchRepository<Book, String> {

    List<Book> findByAuthorsNameContaining(String name);
}
```

Let's create a Test to illustrate how to use the Repository. I created 3 books, and then ensure these operations run properly: save, find by Id, and find by author's name.

```java
@SpringBootTest
class BookServiceTest {
    @Autowired
    private BookService bookService;

    @Autowired
    private BookSearchRepository bookSearchRepository;

    @Autowired
    private ElasticsearchOperations elasticsearchOperations;

    public static final String BOOK_ID_1 = "1";
    public static final String BOOK_ID_2 = "2";
    public static final String BOOK_ID_3 = "3";

    private Book book1;
    private Book book2;
    private Book book3;

    @BeforeEach
    public void beforeEach() {
        // Delete and recreate index
        IndexOperations indexOperations = elasticsearchOperations.indexOps(Book.class);
        indexOperations.delete();
        indexOperations.create();
        indexOperations.putMapping(indexOperations.createMapping());

        // add 2 books to elasticsearch
        Author markTwain = new Author().setId("1").setName("Mark Twain");
        book1 = bookSearchRepository
                .save(new Book().setId(BOOK_ID_1).setName("The Mysterious Stranger")
                        .setAuthors(singletonList(markTwain))
                        .setSummary("This is a fiction book"));

        book2 = bookSearchRepository
                .save(new Book().setId(BOOK_ID_2).setName("The Innocents Abroad")
                        .setAuthors(singletonList(markTwain))
                        .setSummary("This is a special book")
                );

        book3 = bookSearchRepository
                .save(new Book().setId(BOOK_ID_3).setName("The Other Side of the Sky").setAuthors(
                        Arrays.asList(new Author().setId("2").setName("Amie Kaufman"),
                                new Author().setId("3").setName("Meagan Spooner"))));
    }

    /**
     * Read books by id and ensure data are saved properly
     */
    @Test
    void findById() {
        assertEquals(book1, bookSearchRepository.findById(BOOK_ID_1).orElse(null));
        assertEquals(book2, bookSearchRepository.findById(BOOK_ID_2).orElse(null));
        assertEquals(book3, bookSearchRepository.findById(BOOK_ID_3).orElse(null));
    }

    @Test
    public void query() {
        List<Book> books = bookSearchRepository.findByAuthorsNameContaining("Mark");

        assertEquals(2, books.size());
        assertEquals(book1, books.get(0));
        assertEquals(book2, books.get(1));
    }
}

```

In the `beforeEach` method, I recreate the index and insert 3 books to ensure that every test I have fresh new data.

You can go to  [localhost:9200/books/_search](http://localhost:9200/books/_search)  to see all the indexed books. 

Or go to  [localhost:9200/books/_mapping](http://localhost:9200/books/_mapping) to see the detailed mapping of each field.

# Search and Filter
In `BookSearchRepository`, I can name a method and it will be resolved to Elasticsearch JSON query automatically. Another way is to define the JSON query using `@Query` annotation. For example: 

```java
 @Query("{\"match\": {\"name\": {\"query\": \"?0\"}}}")
    Page<Book> findByName(String name, Pageable pageable);
```

These are awesome for simple queries, but in practice, we usually provide the end user with a search field, some filters, and sorting. To achieve this I prefer using the built-in query builder because of its flexibility.

Let's create a BookService to illustrate how to use query builder to form a complex query for searching on multi fields, filtering and sorting

```java
@Service
public class BookService {

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Accessors(chain = true)
    @ToString
    public static class BookSearchInput {
        private String searchText;
        private BookFilter filter;
    }

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Accessors(chain = true)
    @ToString
    public static class BookFilter {
        private String authorName;
    }

    @Autowired
    private ElasticsearchOperations operations;

    public SearchPage<Book> searchBooks(BookSearchInput searchInput, Pageable pageable) {

        // query
        QueryBuilder queryBuilder;
        if(searchInput == null || isEmpty(searchInput.getSearchText())) {
            // search text is empty, match all results
            queryBuilder = QueryBuilders.matchAllQuery();
        } else {
            // search text is available, match the search text in name, summary, and authors.name
            queryBuilder = QueryBuilders.multiMatchQuery(searchInput.getSearchText())
                    .field("name", 3)
                    .field("summary")
                    .field("authors.name")
                    .fuzziness(Fuzziness.ONE) //fuzziness means the edit distance: the number of one-character changes that need to be made to one string to make it the same as another string
                    .prefixLength(2);//The prefix_length parameter is used to improve performance. In this case, we require that the first three characters should match exactly, which reduces the number of possible combinations.;
        }

        // filter by author name
        BoolQueryBuilder filterBuilder = boolQuery();
        if(searchInput.getFilter() != null && isNotEmpty(searchInput.getFilter().getAuthorName())){
            filterBuilder.must(termQuery("authors.name.raw", searchInput.getFilter().getAuthorName()));
        }

        NativeSearchQuery query = new NativeSearchQueryBuilder().withQuery(queryBuilder)
                .withFilter(filterBuilder)
                .withPageable(pageable)
                .build();

        SearchHits<Book> hits = operations.search(query, Book.class);

        return SearchHitSupport.searchPageFor(hits, query.getPageable());
    }
}

```

To test this BookService#searchBook, I add one more test method to BookServiceTest above

```java
@Test
    void searchBook() {

        // Define page request: return the first 10 results. Sort by book's name ASC
        Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(0, 10, Direction.ASC, "name.raw");

        // Case 1: search all books: should return 3 books
        assertEquals(3, bookService.searchBooks(new BookSearchInput(), pageable)
                .getTotalElements());

        // Case 2: filter books by author Mark Twain: Should return [book2, book1]
        SearchPage<Book> booksByAuthor = bookService.searchBooks(
                new BookSearchInput().setFilter(new BookFilter().setAuthorName("Mark Twain")),
                pageable); // sort by book name asc
        assertEquals(2, booksByAuthor.getTotalElements());

        Iterator<SearchHit<Book>> iterator = booksByAuthor.iterator();
        assertEquals(book2, iterator.next().getContent()); // The Innocents Abroad
        assertEquals(book1, iterator.next().getContent()); // The Mysterious Stranger


        // Case 3: search by text 'special': Should return book 2 because it has summary containing 'special'
        // one typo in the search text: (specila) is accepted thanks to `fuziness`
        SearchPage<Book> specialBook = bookService
                .searchBooks(new BookSearchInput().setSearchText("specila"), pageable);// book 2
        assertEquals(1, specialBook.getTotalElements());

        assertEquals(book2, specialBook.getContent().iterator().next().getContent()); // The Innocents Abroad
    }
```

Please notice in `Case  3` above, the search text has one typo it is `specila` instead of special. But it works as expected because I set `.fuzziness(Fuzziness.ONE)` in the query builder.

# Logging
I find it useful to log the JSON query on the development environment to ensure that we produce proper queries.  This log can be enabled in the `application.properties`

```
logging.level.org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.WIRE=trace
```

Now when I run the `searchBook` test method, I can see the Elasticsearch query in the log file as below:
```json
{
    "from": 0,
    "size": 10,
    "query": {
        "multi_match": {
            "query": "special",
            "fields": [
                "authors.name^1.0",
                "name^3.0",
                "summary^1.0"
            ],
            "type": "best_fields",
            "operator": "OR",
            "slop": 0,
            "fuzziness": "1",
            "prefix_length": 2,
            "max_expansions": 50,
            "zero_terms_query": "NONE",
            "auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query": true,
            "fuzzy_transpositions": true,
            "boost": 1.0
        }
    },
    "post_filter": {
        "bool": {
            "adjust_pure_negative": true,
            "boost": 1.0
        }
    },
    "version": true,
    "sort": [
        {
            "name.raw": {
                "order": "asc"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
